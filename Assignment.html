			<h1>Cats Communicate With Humans</h1>
			<p>National Geographic has their take on cats and human communication skills:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/03/160328-cats-communication-animals-pets-science/">Cats use both visual and vocal signals to communicate with humans, but they need to vocalize to get our attention. With other cats, they tend to rely on visual and olfactory signals. When a cat says “meow,” it’s normally addressed to a human being, not another cat. Many cats and their human companions seem to develop a pidgin language in order to communicate better. We don’t know whether there are similarities in the languages or whether they're specific to a cat/human pair.
